# QEMU-KVM on Arch Linux: Running Tiny Core Linux in a Lightweight VM

Virtualization is a powerful tool for developers, sysadmins, and tinkerers alike. On Linux, **QEMU-KVM** stands out as a robust, high-performance virtualization stack. In this blog, well walk through setting up QEMU-KVM on **Arch Linux** and using it to run **Tiny Core Linux**a super-lightweight distro perfect for testing and experimentation.



##  What is QEMU-KVM

**QEMU (Quick Emulator)** is a generic and open-source machine emulator. On its own, it can emulate various hardware systems. However, when paired with **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)**a Linux kernel module for virtualizationit can run virtual machines with near-native performance.

- **QEMU** provides device emulation and user-space management.
- **KVM** integrates with the Linux kernel and handles hardware-level virtualization.

Together, they effectively form a **Type 1 hypervisor** because the Linux kernel (with KVM) handles core virtualization tasks directly on hardware.



##  Step-by-Step: Installing QEMU-KVM on Arch Linux

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S qemu virt-manager virt-viewer dnsmasq vde2 bridge-utils openbsd-netcat libvirt edk2-ovmf
```

 `edk2-ovmf` is for UEFI firmware support in VMs.

### Step 2: Enable and Start libvirtd

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd.service
```

### Step 3: Add Your User to the `libvirt` Group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG libvirt (whoami)
newgrp libvirt
```

### Step 4: Verify KVM Support

```bash
lsmod  grep kvm
```

And check CPU virtualization support:

```bash
egrep -c (vmxsvm) /proc/cpuinfo
```

 A value of 1 or more indicates virtualization support.



##  Example: Running Tiny Core Linux on QEMU-KVM

Now that your system is ready, lets run **Tiny Core Linux**, a minimalist Linux distro thats only 16MB

### Step 1: Download Tiny Core ISO

```bash
wget http://tinycorelinux.net/14.x/x86/release/Core-current.iso
```

 Or visit [http://tinycorelinux.net](http://tinycorelinux.net) for the latest release.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Disk (Optional)

```bash
qemu-img create -f qcow2 tinycore.qcow2 512M
```

 This creates a 512MB disk image. Optional for RAM-only usage.

### Step 3: Launch the VM with KVM Acceleration

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64   -enable-kvm   -m 512   -cpu host   -smp 1   -cdrom Core-current.iso   -hda tinycore.qcow2   -boot d   -net nic -net user   -vga virtio   -display sdl
```
Key Flags Explained:

    -enable-kvm: Enables KVM hardware acceleration

    -m 512: Allocates 512MB RAM

    -cpu host: Uses the host CPU features

    -cdrom: Points to the Tiny Core ISO

    -hda: Uses a QCOW2 disk image

    -boot d: Boots from CD first

    -net user: Enables simple user-mode networking (e.g., for internet access)

    -display sdl: Uses SDL window for graphics (you can replace with gtk or virt-manager)

### Alternate: Boot Tiny Core in RAM Without Disk

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64   -enable-kvm   -m 256   -cdrom Core-current.iso   -boot d   -net nic -net user   -vga std
```



##  Conclusion

With QEMU-KVM, Arch Linux becomes a full-featured Type 1 hypervisor. By combining kernel-level virtualization (KVM) with the flexibility of QEMU, you get a fast, customizable virtualization platform. Running **Tiny Core Linux** showcases just how lightweight and efficient this setup can be.

Whether youre building VMs for testing, learning Linux internals, or experimenting with custom environments, QEMU-KVM on Arch is a powerful combination.
