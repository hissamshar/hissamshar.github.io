title: 'How to Connect a Raspberry PI 5 to USB TTY Cable'
---

Connecting a Raspberry Pi 5 to a USB TTY cable is a common way to interact with it through a serial connection, especially for debugging or setting up the device without using a display.

**Prerequists**
1. Raspberry Pi 5.
2. USB TTY (serial) cable.
3. Computer with a terminal emulator (minicom/screen).
4. GPIO pinout diagram of Raspberry Pi 5 (for reference).
4. Power source for Raspberry Pi (optional if USB TTY can power it, though not recommended).

**How to Connect**

- Locate the GPIO Pins
- Find the GPIO header on the Raspberry Pi 5.
- Identify the following pins:

**GND (Ground): Usually black wire on the USB TTY cable.
TX (Transmit): Sends data from the Pi to the computer.
RX (Receive): Receives data from the computer to the Pi.**

Use a GPIO pinout chart to locate these pins. For Raspberry Pi 5, it will likely be similar to previous models.
