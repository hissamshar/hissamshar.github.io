Hosting a website on GitHub Pages with Hugo involves the following steps:

# Creating a website

**1. Install Hugo and git**

    > sudo pacman -S Hugo

**2. Create a new Hugo site**

    > hugo new site your-website

**3. Add a Theme**

Navigate to your website directory and add a theme. You can choose one from the [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) . 

    > cd your-website
    > git init 
    > git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/hugo-PaperMod
Now you will need to update the hugo.toml file for them to take effect. To do so you can either *echo* or addd it in the file.
    
    > echo "theme = 'hugo-PaperMod'" >> hugo.toml

To view the website you can run it locally using Hugo's development server to view the site. You can add -D to see your drafts.

    > hugo server

**3. Add Content** 

To add a new page to your site.

    > hugo new content content/posts/yout-first-post.md

**This is it** You have done it. YAY!

# Hosting it on GitHub

**1. Create a GitHub repository.**
- Click the + icon in the top-right corner of:> [!WARNING]
- the GitHub interface and select New repository.
- Enter a repository name: ***yourusername.github.io***
- Click Create repository.

**2. Add Files for Your website**

Clone the repository locally using Git:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git

Add your static site files (generated by Hugo) to the repository.
Commit and push the changes:

    > git add -A
    > git commit -s -m "Initial commit"
    > git push origin main


**3. Configure the Repository for GitHub Pages**

- Go to the Settings tab of your new repository.
- Scroll down to the Pages section. **Settings > Pages**. 
- In the center of your screen you will see this: **Build and development**
- Change the *Source* to **GitHub Actions**.

**4. Create a file named hugo.yaml in a directory named .github/workflows.**

    > mkdir -p .github/workflows 
    > cd ./github/workflows touch hugo.yaml

**5. Add content in the YAML file.**

**5. Commit and push your GitHub repository.**

    >git add -A
    >git commit -m "Create hugo.yaml"
    >git push

**6. Deployment status**
From GitHubâ€™s main menu, choose Actions. When GitHub has finished building and deploying your site, the color of the status indicator will change to green.

Step 5: Verify Your GitHub Pages Site

The site will be live at **https://yourusername.github.io**.
