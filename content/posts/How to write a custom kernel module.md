## Linux Kernal

The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, Unix-like kernel widely used in computer systems around the world. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system (OS), designed as a free alternative to Unix. Since the late 1990s, the Linux kernel has been included in numerous operating system distributions, many of which are referred to as Linux. One prominent example is Android, a Linux-based operating system widely used in mobile and embedded devices.

The majority of the kernel's code is written in C, leveraging extensions provided by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) beyond standard C. Additionally, it includes assembly code for architecture-specific functions, such as optimizing memory usage and task execution. Architecturally, the Linux kernel is monolithic, meaning the entire OS operates within kernel space. However, it features a modular design, allowing software components to be integrated as modules, including dynamic loading.

## What Is A Kernel Module?

A Linux kernel module is precisely defined as a code segment capable of dynamic loading and unloading within the kernel as needed. These modules enhance kernel capabilities without necessitating a system reboot. A notable example is seen in the device driver module, which facilitates kernel interaction with hardware components linked to the system.
