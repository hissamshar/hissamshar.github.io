I’m a Computer Science student at FAST NUCES with a growing focus on systems, tooling, and developer experience. Through my work at COLAB NU as a Tier 1 member, I’ve built static sites with Hugo, written custom Linux kernel modules, experimented with Raspberry Pi based embedded systems, and configured virtualization stacks using KVM/QEMU with libvirt and virt-manager.

Outside of classes, I like building things from the ground up: a minimal text editor and POSIX shell in C, a ray tracer in C++, and a full computer system via Nand2Tetris, from logic gates to a working compiler. I’m active in communities like AWS, and my university book club, where I learn, share, and collaborate. I enjoy writing, tinkering with low-level tools, and helping others get closer to how computers really work.
